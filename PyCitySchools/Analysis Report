Based on the data analyzed, what I have observed are as per below points:
    
    1. Independent schools have higher average scores on math, reading and also higher percentage of students passing in both subjects. (3 out of five top performing schools are Independent and 4 out of five lowest performing schools are Goverment).
    
    2. Smaller size Schools have higher average scores and percentage of students passing in both subjects compare to the larger schools.(3 out of five top performing schools size is < 20000 and all fiveowest performing schools size > 2000).
    
    3. Schools Spending power and budget have little impact on overall average student scores passing rates
